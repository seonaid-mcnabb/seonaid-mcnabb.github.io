                            <p> Before I begin, and in the interest of full disclosure, here is the truth: when I started my tech journey,
                                I was broken-assed*, broken-hearted, and listening to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE1myC5yx8s">“Strong Enough”</a>** upwards of twenty-five times a day.
                                There you have it. If you're looking for an orderly guide to making a career change, you've landed in the wrong 
                                place. For me, the decision to pursue my technical education was, at first, more of a blind run forward through a dark
                                forest of ABBA ballads and insomnia. And then it was a lot like falling in love. </p>

                                <blockquote>*I had rage cycled my way into a rather upsetting case of gluteal tendinopathy
                                    <br />**Fake it 'til you make it at its finest
                                </blockquote>

<p>Prior to making this decision, my experience in tech was the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>	Using HTML to change the background on my Xanga journal </li>
<li>Adding more RAM to the family computer so that my Sims games would run faster </li>
<li>	Designing a fake internet company called “Seo Online” and advertising it to my family members
     via e-mails sent from my Hotmail account (written, naturally, in Comic Sans) </li>
</ol>

<p>
Life got a bit weird and broody for me pretty early on, though. For a dozen or so ill-informed reasons, I felt that I needed to
commit myself exclusively to the arts and humanities. And despite a brief stint with biology and a latent interest in Computer Science,
that belief persisted. I ended up studying Literature and Spanish at university, and tried to be a good person who wrote mediocre 
poetry. Before deciding to take up programming this fall, I had already graduated from that literature degree, moved abroad,
and been part of the workforce for more than a decade, primarily within the academic and health sectors. While I'm sure that 
sounds super neat, linear and professional, the <i>reality</i> of it is that I have been making ends meet for as long
as I've been able to. During this time, I have been: </p>
<ul>
<li>Perpetually stressed about and mystified by money</li>
<li>Worried about finding work that felt meaningful to me, and which also allowed me to grow intellectually and financially </li>
<li>Doubtful of my own abilities and accomplishments</li>
<li>Almost always working multiple jobs at the same time: advisor, teacher, catering waitress, call center operator, 
    transcriptionist, secretary, sales associate, book-store clerk, private tutor, the girl in charge of getting the 
    Starbucks orders, CV consultant, unpaid therapist, stuffer-of-envelopes, trimmer-of-leaves, alphabetizer-of-files... 
    you get the picture.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did not realize, until I was well into adulthood, that there was any other way of existing
in the world. Career flexibility, investment, and risk-taking? Those all seemed like luxuries that belonged to the realm of the rich 
or to people much braver, more intelligent, and less sensitive than I was. But by the summer of 2021, I'd had enough of just about 
everything, especially self-doubt. </p>

<p>On encouragement from a new friend, I signed up for free JavaScript courses on Codecademy, checked out mathematics and logic books
 from the library, and tried to get a feel for the different jobs available within the tech field. I knew I needed a change and I knew
that I needed that change, as much as it hurt my secretly-romantic bohemian soul, to be one that would give me a better shot at breaking
out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. After discovering that I was actually really intrigued by what I was learning about programming 
and logic, I applied to a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at CodeOp in the fall. I got in and, with the help of my sister, was able
to pay the tuition fees. </p>

<p> The fairy-tale part of this story is that I ended up loving absolutely everything about the process of web
development and computer science. The constant learning. The errors. The problem-solving. The confidence that it gave me as I began to
unravel tough problems and make sense of new concepts.  The healthier relationship with failure that it allowed me to develop. The reward 
of creating an application that has actually made my life easier, and of getting better at breaking problems of all types into smaller, more
 manageable tasks. I even love (despite the frustrations) my beginner status, the fact that I've only just brushed the surface and that there is so much more to learn.
So if you have ended up here because you are considering exploring tech, please take a few things away from this post: </p>
<ol>
<li>You are definitely strong enough. </li>
<li>It is not un-noble to take your financial goals into account when seeking out a career change. Let me repeat that in bold in
	case anyone else has experienced the same weird shame about making money as I have: IT IS OKAY TO WANT AND WORK TOWARDS FINANCIAL
	FREEDOM FOR YOURSELF.
<li>Tech, like the world in general, is as creative, abstract, and exciting as you make it. You need not be a hoodie-wearing basement-dweller
	with Cheetoh dust on his fingers in order to learn to program. So let's toss that stereotype out the window once and for all.
<li>And finally… If you're waiting for the “ideal” time to make a change or to do something that scares you, prepare yourself for a life
	that looks like standing water. Would you rather be a swamp, or a river? Yes, I know that this sounds a lot like “just do it,”
	a truism that has a fueled a thousand Nike campaigns. I get it. It's annoying. But it doesn't make it any less true. </li>
</ol>

<p> So go ahead. Be the river. Whatever that looks like for you. </p>
