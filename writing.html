								Long before the internet there was Ovid, who said, <i> be patient and tough; someday this pain will be useful to you. </i> <br /> <br />

							It is of course highly improbable that Ovid was referring to the career-changer's job search when he said this, but it is a quote 
							that comes to my mind fairly often lately: I am utterly unemployed and staring down an enormous and complex field that I wish I'd begun
							to study ten years ago. The stage is well-set for the next act, which promises to be anxiety-inducing at best and soul-crushing at worst. </p>

								Before I begin and in the interest of full disclosure, here is the truth: when I started my tech journey, I was broken-assed*, broken-hearted, and 
								listening to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE1myC5yx8s">“Strong Enough”</a>** upwards of twenty-five times a day. There you have it. If you're looking for an orderly guide to making a career change, 
								you've landed in the wrong place. For me, the decision to pursue my technical education was, at first, more of a blind run forward through a dark 
								forest of ABBA ballads and insomnia. And then it was a lot like falling in love. </p>
